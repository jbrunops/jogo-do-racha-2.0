<h3 align="left">Hello, welcome! I want to introduce you to the "Jogo do Racha", an interactive game designed to make a group of friends' fun even more enjoyable.</h3>

###

<h2 align="left">What is Racha?</h2>

<p align="left">Racha is nothing more than a popular synonym for football, widely used here in the northeast. In other words: two teams gather to play several football matches, and the winning team generally pays for the drinks and food at the end of the tournament, which usually happens one day a week.</p>

<h2 align="left">What's the game's proposal?</h2>

<p align="left">The group was always downloading similar games, but never found something that combined these elements: sueca and "imprensadinho". With the idea of making something similar, I took the sueca cards and transformed them into phrases and kept the numbers from "imprensadinho" there, serving as a kind of "minefield".</p>

<h2 align="left">Is the game ready?</h2>

<p align="left">No, it is not ready. It is still in the beta phase, simple, and with several errors. Feel free to collaborate, but keep the credits and originality if you want to contribute.</p>
